in preparation for the wednesday walk-thru, i propose to make changes to this page:
  https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/pages/content/amp-dev/about/how-amp-works.html
  https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works

here is the yaml file that sets directory properties
  https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/pages/content/amp-dev/about/_blueprint.yaml

content in the target file is contained in <main>
here is the default.j2 that controls <main>
  https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/frontend/templates/views/default.j2

related content (content.j2) is defined here:
  https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/frontend/templates/views/partials/content.j2

how-amp-works uses the view
  https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/frontend/templates/views/overview/custom-content.j2

there you will see this statement:
  {{ doc.html|render|safe }}
which means that the document use inline HTML as the content format (not Markdown as the content format)

my plan is to modify the content of how-amp-works as a test case

separately, Ankita will provide a change to the menus - replacing one SVG with a substitute SVG
she has done this before so we can reuse that process as a test case

as part of the walk-thru, Divyansh will teach us how to version the test cases according to his workflow, and teach us how to activate a build to check the test cases
---

also, i am studying how the PATHs are set
for static paths (e.g. how-amp-works), content is rendered correctly
but the balance of ontomatica.com does not render correctly
once we learn how to customize the PATH statements, ontomatica.com should work exactly as does amp.dev
---

there is one other issue we should discuss
ontomatica.com does not use the latest release of amp.dev

the question:
should we upgrade to the latest release - potentially losing the placeholder to search
should we continue with the current release and make search work as part of the process of correcting PATH variables
---

i will have alt content for how-amp-works on wednesday
Divyansh then can stage that change as part of the walk-thru
---

let me know if you see errors or problems with the above information and approach
