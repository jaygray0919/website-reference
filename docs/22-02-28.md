# Meeting Notes: 22-02-28

## Project objectives

- From a single GitHub repository, generate separate sites for 6 companies that are part of a single Consortium

## Project Management

### Leadership

- Consortium's Project Manager (PM) resides in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India
- PM is point-of-contact
- PM will conduct regular calls/meeting with Stripe to review progress
- PM understands "how we work", sees the "big picture" and is trusted by Consortium management
- PM has Docker and node.js/Express experience
- PM controls Consortium AWS privileges and services and will provide appropriate AWS access, authorization and authentication

## Project Sequence

### Stage 1

- Docker [amp.dev master](https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev)
- Label: Docker-LOCAL
- Target runtime environments: Win10 and AWS/EC2/Linux (Red Hat)

There are many actions that we do not expect will work in Docker-LOCAL. Examples:
- search
- server processes such as amp-optimizer

Learning what *doesn't work* for Stage 1 is just as important as learning *what does work*.

Upon delivery of Stage 1, Ontomatica will test the following:

*1a.* generate homepage for 1 site
- [ontomatica](https://afdsi.com/ontomatica-home/)

*1b.* generate sidebar menu level 1 and 2 and target page for level 2

*1c.* generate page with accordion footer
- example [link: accordion](https://ontomatica.io/a/12370110501010001939/)

*1d.* generate Natural Language (NL) site menu
- example [link: natural languages](https://ontomatica.io/a/12370110501010001939/)

*1e.* generate page with amp-list using double brace JSON {{text}}
- example [link: double braces](https://ontomatica.io/a/12370110501010001939/)

*1f.* generate page with amp-list using triple brace JSON {{{text}}}
- example [link: triple braces](https://ontomatica.io/a/12120000001000011961/)

*1g.* inject JSON-LD
- example [link: json-ld](https://ontomatica.io/a/12370110501010001939/)

*1h.* generate page using amp-iframe
- example [link: iFrame](https://afdsi.com/ontomatica-home/)

Ontomatica will require 1-2 weeks to test 1a. - 1h.
